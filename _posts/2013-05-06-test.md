title: Norm and Li-norm
---
In mathematics, a *norm* is a function that assigns a strictly positive length or size to each vector in a vector space, other than the zero vector. A *seminorm*, on the other hand, is allowed to assign zero length to some non-zero vectors(in addition to the zero vector). Norm may come in many forms and many names, including these popular names: Euclidean distance, Mean-squared Error, etc. Usually, norm appears in this form:
$$\\| x \\|$$
where $$$x$$$ is a vector or matrix, for example, a Euclidean norm of a vector $$$a = \[1, 2, 3\]^T$$$ is:
$$ \\| a \\|_2 = \\sqrt{1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2} $$


## L0-norm

$$\\| x \\|_0 = \\sum x_i^0$$
That is the number of non-zero elements.

## L1-norm

$$\\| x \\|_1 = \\sum |x_i| $$
That is the sum of each element's absolute value.

## L2-norm

$$\\| x \\|_2 = \\sqrt{\\sum x_i^2}$$
It is also called *Euclidean norm*.

## Linfinity-norm

For $$$p \\geq 1$$$, 
$$\\| x \\|_p = (\\sum |x_i|^p)^{\\frac{1}{p}}$$

For infinity, the definition looks very tricky,
$$\\| x\\|\_{\\infty} = \\sqrt\[\\infty\]{\\sum |x\_i|^{\\infty}} $$

Fortunately, this equation can be transformed into a very simple format, let's suppose $$$m$$$ be the largest number of $$$x$$$, by the property of infinity we have $$$m^{\\infty} \\gg x_i^{\\infty}$$$, when $$$x_i \\neq m$$$.So, $$$\\| x \\|\_{\\infty} = \\sqrt\[\\infty\]{k|m|^{\\infty}}$$$, where k is the number of largest numbers in $$$x$$$, still thanks for the property of infinity, we have $$$\\sqrt\[\\infty\]{k} = 1 $$$, at last, the Linfinity-norm is:

$$\\| x\\|_{\\infty} = max(|x_i|)$$
